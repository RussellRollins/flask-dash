# flask-dash

Flask-Dash is a project which allows an Amazon Dash button to be repurposed to control a Flask backed server. As built, Flask-Dash just toggles the state of whether or not my dishwasher is clean. However, this strategy could easily be extended to use Dash buttons for all kinds of things.
